# amina-terminal
Welcome to my interactive terminal-style portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and resume through a retro hacker-themed interface, sound effects and a Matrix-inspired background. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, jQuery and Typed.js, it's a fun way to present my work.
